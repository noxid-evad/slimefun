# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our Library



{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Heads Up**</mark> I am still in the process of writing this library. Many pages may appear to be completely empty but they've in fact just not been published as of yet.
{% endhint %}

We're happy to welcome you to our first ever Library for the server. I have spent countless hours working on it and now it's all available to you. \
\
It's worth taking into consideration that as our library is new, there may be some things that are missing or incomplete. Please ensure that if you come across something like this then you report them to myself so i can fix them asap. \
\
Happy browsing and feel free to ask any questions that are not already answered on this library.
