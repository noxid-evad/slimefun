# Updates

## Version 1.06 - CRITICAL - 23/10/2022

Unfortunately due to the server continuously crashing this evening, and with nothing to go on by within the crash logs. I have tried my best to find a possible solution with tweaks to see if that helps the server and sadly, the end result is the exact same. To protect the server (and of course your precious bases etc) \
\
I have had to put in a backup from (2 days ago) as this backup was last taken (21/10/2022 - @ 5am gmt) What does that mean?\
\
\- Any progress you've made on the server between the above and now has been lost and there is no way for us to recover it. This crash is out of my control and sadly it's a one in a blue moon moment. \
\
Fingers crossed this solves the issue, Just for safe keeping, i will try to get to your bases and create a schematic (and also backup your region file.mca files - you can see this by pressing F3 and looking for #.#.mca region file) \
\
If the issue continues to persist and remains at critical level then i may be forced to take drastic action, however that will only be a last resort.&#x20;

## Version 1.0.5 - 18/10/2022

{% hint style="success" %}
I am please to say that we now have a wide range of custom enchantments & books more information will be found [here](https://1blockoff.gitbook.io/1blockoff-library/global/custom-enchantments) (For the time being it's not possible to get these books from villagers, but i am actively working on that)\
\
This will provide users with even more things to do and achieve in the server.\
\
With regards to Slimefun (As we haven't really got into it yet, I have disabled a few plugins for the time being) i need to collectively go through these addons bit by bit to see what benefits the server for the better. \
\
I am trying to improve the server in anyway i can to better your user experience, whilst it isn't the finished article (and i am the only one actively working on it as much as possible) so your support, suggestions, ideas, feedback helps with this. \
\
Enjoy the enchantments\
\
ps: i have added even more [CRAFTING RECIPES](https://1blockoff.gitbook.io/1blockoff-library/global/custom-crafting) you can find these in the vanilla workbench

**As the world is already pre-generated via a datapack, and not through the usual means. These datapacks whilst installed will not take effect until i pre-generate new chunks within the world. Currently i am awaiting feedback from devs if it is safe to remove region files, or expand into new lands**\
\
Some requested packs cannot be installed due to varying reasons such as incompatible and/or require a resource pack which in turn is something i don't want to get involved with just yet. However i am open to custom textures in the future (but this would require help from others for achieving) \

## Version 1.0.2 - 18/09/2022

<mark style="color:yellow;">**VOTING FOR SERVER**</mark>\ <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark>- <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> Plugin has now been reconfigured and users can now freely vote on the following sites\
[https://minecraft-server-list.com/server/486841/vote/\
https://minecraftservers.org/vote/320843\
https://minecraft-server.net/vote/EKTnoxidevad/\
https://topmcservers.com/server/1266/vote\
https://minecraft-mp.com/server/310235/vote/\
https://minecraft.buzz/vote/4659](https://minecraft-server-list.com/server/486841/vote/https://minecraftservers.org/vote/320843https:/minecraft-server.net/vote/EKTnoxidevad/https://topmcservers.com/server/1266/votehttps://minecraft-mp.com/server/310235/vote/https://minecraft.buzz/vote/4659)\
\
By voting for us on the above link, you will help our server move up the ladder system with the hope of attracting new players to the server and being more active. \
\
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Voting Rewards**</mark>\
\- Every vote gets you £100 in-game money (so £600 if voted on all sites)\
\- You will also receive a "Vote Key" these can be used at spawn at the vote crate\
\
There is other crates i am working on, however for the time being only Vote Crate will be accessible until i have completed the rest. \
\
Users can also see who won which item(s) by looking in the [#crates](https://discordapp.com/channels/233745341793566724/1014509032112914533/1021060435509772338) channel\
\
&#x20;_<mark style="color:red;">**TIP**</mark>_** ** \
1\) Due to how voting works with the service sites, Users who share the same IP address can only vote once per 15-24hrs on each link which means only one user can vote from that IP \
\
\- To get around this (_<mark style="color:orange;">You may be able to vote via your mobile or vpn</mark>_) if the service sites allows it. \
\
2\) Make sure you have enough inventory slots available prior to opening the crates, otherwise items may not be given and/or may be dropped where you stand. We will not replace any key/item regardless.&#x20;

## Version 1.0.1 - 08/09/2022

Server was experiencing major issues for a good few hours (sadly myself was at work all day, and Goku was on family duties) whilst you may not of noticed/experienced any major dip in performance or stability, the console was being heavily spammed (and also being rate limited)\
\
After soul searching for around 60 minutes i think i may of finally solved the issue and hopefully that puts the issue to bed. I won't go into to much detail about the issue as it's not a player affecting issue. \
\
We will continue to monitor the situation and if the issue arises again then we will need to lockdown server to further diagnose the problem.\
\
Happy crafting
