# Electric Machines

Now we get on to the fun stuff & the core of Slimefun lies within the Electric Machines. They will allow for complex and complete automation of production, from Enhanced farming, Dust, Ingot factories and much much more.&#x20;

All of the machines listed require and consume enery, and can also interact with cargo (but they cannot interact with hoppers) Some of the Electric machines have a tier system which will increase their speed but also their energy consumption. \


The <mark style="color:orange;">**energy buffer**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;"></mark> of an electric machine is the amount of energy it removes from the network the first time it is connected to it. This energy is stored in the network and is still usable by machines (energy may go into the negatives).\


<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE**</mark><mark style="color:red;">:</mark> An Electric Machine may operate without any energy present, when an appropriate recipe is added to its input slots, and _consume_ the items you have placed inside while doing so. However, it will not take any energy and it will not finish the process of crafting your recipe. This means that the items you have placed inside the Machine are still inside, but _inaccessible_; and that the Machine requires (more) energy in order to finish processing and give you the crafted items.

_<mark style="color:red;">**Warning: Do NOT break these machines with items inside, while processing or not processing. The items may disappear! And we will not compensate any items lost.**</mark>_&#x20;
