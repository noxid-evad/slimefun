# Server Description

Do you enjoy playing Vanilla Minecraft but often feel it gets a little stale and boring with the same old biomes and terrain? Then welcome to 1Blockoff. Read below for what our server focuses on.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Slimefun" %}
Slimefun is a plugin that aims to enhance or modernize many different aspects of gameplay. Adding in over 500+ items and new features such as jetpacks, programmable androids, cargo, energy and electricity, magical Armor & items and much more. \
\
We are currently in the process of adding some officially supported addons which will vastly improve the quality of the server as well as adding in even more new items for you to research, unlock and explore.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Towny" %}
For many years we used the Lands plugin for our land protection, However we feel that with the changes the developer has been making recently this plugin is slowly going down the toilet, not to mention the pathetic support that is very much non existent, even after providing proof of purchase they still won't verify us in the discord. So I have now decided to stop using all of his plugins (this includes ChestProtect). \
\
Towny is our new official land protection plugin, it will allow you to create a town, which in turn you can invite other players to (providing you meet the requirements) The owner of the town is called a Mayor, whilst the members of a town are called its residents.\

Terralith adds over 85+ new biomes, and updates nearly all of the biomes from the orignal version with new and improved features. It also includes a ton of new terrain such as canyons, fragmented biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches and much more. \
\
The style of Terralith is designed to appeal to everyone. There are plenty of realistic biomes like Yellowstone, Shield, and Highlands, but also fantastic places like the Skylands, Moonlight Grove, and even the elusive Mirage Isles. You’ll never run out of new biomes and experiences to discover.\

Resource Pack: [**Incendium\_Optional\_RP\_5.5.zip**](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/downloads-library/raw/main/Incendium/Resource%20Pack/Incendium\_Optional\_RP\_5.5.zip)****\
****_this resource pack is optional, however if you wish to see the custom items as intended then this pack is highly recommended._
{% endhint %}

With Incendium you can find 8 new Biomes, which spawn alongside the already existing ones. It’s also worth nothing that the height of the Nether has been increased to 192 blocks high, making the terrain much better.

The Biomes that you can find are the Ash Barrens, Infernal Dunes, Inverted Forest, Quartz Flats, Toxic Heap, Volcanic Deltas, Weeping Valley and Withered Forest.\
\
There is also around 10 structures included by Incendium in its current form. These are of all different sizes, with some being bigger than any other structure that currently exists in Minecraft.\
\
You can find the Abandoned Tower, Forbidden Castle, Infernal Altar, Nether Reactor, Piglin Village, Pipeline, Quartz Kitchen, Ruined Lab and the Sanctum. While a small amount of these structures don’t offer a lot to do, some are like complete dungeons, taking a long time to fully explore.

The largest has to be the Forbidden Castle, which is full of hostile Piglins, some of which are wearing Armor. But in most of these structures, you can find lots of loot too, if you can safely retrieve it. Make sure to search every Barrel and Chest you come across.

The End is a barren, depressing, bleak place. As it should be, and always will be.\
\
Nullscape overhauls some vanilla end biomes with new features and blocks. All Vanilla biomes can benefit from the new terrain shapes, from wavy-patterns to mountains and plateaus, New sub-biomes can also appear in this overhauled terrain, like Chorus groves, and Voltaic heaps, an area struck by magnetic lightining causing the ground to have patterns of burned terrain which also cause Glowstone forks to come out of the ground\
\
This introduces a new terrain system based around materials science. Essentially, different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and a different 'feel' to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain to stretched alien landscapes to stacked rounded islands, you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.
