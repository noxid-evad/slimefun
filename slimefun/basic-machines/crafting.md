# Crafting

Basic machines are the corner stone of Slimefun production. Most of them are necessary in order to advance to higher tiers of Slimefun. Most of them only need a correct recipe in order to operate.

Mutli-block machines are machines that consist of multiple blocks which have to be placed down vertically in the world, as shown in the Slimefun guide.

_<mark style="color:green;">keep in mind that machines that process items individually, prioritize them from left to right and top to bottom.</mark>_
