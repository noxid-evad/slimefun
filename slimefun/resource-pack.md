# Resource Pack

As there is no official texture pack for Slimefun and very few actual texture packs compatible for today's version, this is the best one i could find that actually works pretty decent without any issues. The resource pack is based around RaulH22's & HauntedCorpse's textures, It is designed around the Optifine / MCPatcher CIT.

## Features

* Works without the needs of item-models.yml
* Support for dark GUI for [Vanilla Tweak](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) users
*   Works with Slimefun's new translation feature

    &#x20;

## Usage

* Vanilla / Forge: You need to install [Optfine](https://optifine.net/downloads)
* Fabric: Install [CIT Resewn](https://1blockoff.xyz/CITResewn-1.1.1+1.19.jar) (file: 1.1.1+1.19) compatible for 1.19.X
* \*DarkGUi: [Slimefun-Beautified-Darkv1.0](https://1blockoff.xyz/Slimefun-Beautified-Dark\_v1.0.zip)
* LightGUI: [Slimefun-Beautified-Light\_v1.0](https://1blockoff.xyz/Slimefun-Beautified-Light\_v1.0.zip)
* \*_Dark version is intended for people who use the Dark UI from VanillaTweaks. If you don't use this, download the light version_

Although this resource is essentially designed for versions 1.18.X, it also works with 1.19.X upon loading the resource pack you will be met with _<mark style="color:orange;">this pack was made for an older version of minecraft and may no longer work correctly</mark>._ just press ok and enjoy your new textures use the    _<mark style="color:green;">**/sf guide**</mark>_ to see the changes. Installation and usage of this texture pack is solely optional and not a requirement for the server.&#x20;

Note: You can still enjoy Slimefun without the texture pack, however it does make it slightly harder trying to identify what each item is on basic vanilla.&#x20;
