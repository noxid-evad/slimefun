# What is Slimefun

Welcome to the Slimefun Library !

Slimefun is a plugin that aims to enhance or modernize many different aspects of gameplay. Adding in over 500+ items and new features such as jetpacks, programmable androids, cargo, energy and electricity, magical Armor & items and much more.  Think of it as a modded server but without having to install any mods on your client.&#x20;

If you haven't got one already in your hotbar or inventory, you can give yourself a Slimefun Guide book at anytime by using the _<mark style="color:green;">/sf guide command</mark>_, When opened this book presents you with a menu where you can research different components and machines needed to craft and create everything contained within this plugin.

By spending your vanilla Minecraft experience levels, you can <mark style="color:red;">`unlock recipes`</mark> for everything Slimefun has to offer. Note that every time you unlock something fireworks will be launched to celebrate; <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark> _<mark style="color:green;">this can be turned off in the guides</mark> setting_ otherwise make sure there's clear space above your head to prevent taking any damage.&#x20;
