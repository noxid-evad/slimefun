<mark style="color:purple;">**How to get vote tokens if i don't want to vote for the server?**</mark>\ <mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>You're permitted to trade and/or sell your vote tokens to another player providing you're not ripping them off (ie trading 1 vote token for 1 dirt) \
\
Vote tokens are a privilege on 1blockoff as another way for myself to thank you the user for continuing to support our server.  With that being said it can be removed at any given time without notice. So please do not abuse the system and/or try to find exploits. Anyone who is caught exploiting the system for there own personal gain or just trying to be a general asshat will be instantly removed from the server for a prolong period time and depending on the seriousness may result in inventories, bases etc being wiped.&#x20;
