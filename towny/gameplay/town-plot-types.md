# Town Plot Types

To set a plot with your town to a type, simply type _<mark style="color:green;">**/plot set \<typename>**</mark>_ see below for the typenames&#x20;

It will cost £500 from the town bank to set a plot type

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Identifying a Plot**</mark>\
TIP: 1 plot = 1 chunk\
\
You can easily enable chunk borders by press <mark style="color:orange;">F3+G</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">(CMD+F3+G on mac)</mark> You will then need to do _<mark style="color:green;">**/towny map big**</mark>_ and this should pop up with a list of plots (chunks) nearby and a key to identifying them.\
\
If you see a <mark style="color:green;">**£**</mark> this would indicate that a plot is for sale in your town that you can purchase. whilst a £ would indicate a plot that's for sale in a different town.\
\
To purchase a plot that is up for sale, simply stand inside the plot and do _<mark style="color:green;">**/plot claim**</mark>_
