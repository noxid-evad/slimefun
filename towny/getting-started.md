## Towny

Your first step upon joining the server should be protecting yourself, as the server difficulty is set to hard there will be an increase number of mobs trying to hunt you down. You'll want to ideally be _<mark style="color:blue;">**making a town**</mark>_ as fast possible, As you don't have enough money to begin with straight away. You'll have to _<mark style="color:blue;">**join a job**</mark>_ in order to gain money and/or sell items to our server shop. Creating or joining a town gives you a place of safety to store your items without worrying about them getting stolen, and a great way to make new friends within the community. As an extra layer of protection users can also run the command /pv # (change # for a number ie: /pv 1) to protect there treasured items, so regardless if your offline for a long period of time or something happens to your town, then any item in your private vault was always be safe and secured no matter what.&#x20;
