**Town Taxes**\
****Some towns may have taxes enabled to help the mayor pay for their town's upkeep. You can view a town's taxes by using the <mark style="color:yellow;">/t \<town name></mark> prices in-game. When the money is taken from your balance, it is put directly into the town bank.

{% hint style="info" %}
Town taxes are taken daily at <mark style="color:red;">**11pm GMT**</mark> from the town bank
{% endhint %}

> As the mayor of the town, you can choose how much you want to tax your fellow residents using <mark style="color:yellow;">/t set taxes \<amount></mark>, or alternatively you can use <mark style="color:yellow;">/t toggle taxpercent</mark> to set tax to be a percentage of your resident's balance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using <mark style="color:red;">**"percentage tax"**</mark> may discourage players from wanting to join your town, as players with a high balance may be excessively taxed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Bankruptcy

In order to prevent your town from going bankrupt, you must have enough money credited in your town bank to pay your town's upkeep each day. If you cannot pay the amount that is due, your town will enter into what is known as a <mark style="color:yellow;">bankrupt state</mark> and the bank will go into the negatives. In this state you will not be able to make any adjustments to your town until you put enough money in the bank to reach a positive bank balance again.
